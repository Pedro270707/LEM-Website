  Bedrock edition works very different than Java Edition under the hood, this means just Geyser alone is not enough to make LEM playable on bedrock.

  Bedrock edition works very different than Java Edition under the hood, this means just Geyser alone is not enough to make LEM playable on bedrock.

  Many elements, such as the UI, Menus, and Game Mechanics (ladder climb speed, knockback, etc.) need to be accounted for before Bedrock can be fully playable.

  Bedrock support was being experimented with in the past, but due primarily to concerns with Minecraft Marketplace, as well as some other technical issues we have no plans to natively support bedrock edition.

  This is subject to change at a future date, however many factors will play into if we do decide, and are able to support bedrock edition.

  In the event you happen to be a mojang employee, and would like us to support bedrock, please feel free to reach out, and we can attempt to work out a solution.
